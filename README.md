This program implements the Banker's Algorithm to manage resource allocation safely and avoid deadlocks. It reads initial data from input.txt and allows users to simulate resource requests dynamically. The program verifies safety after each request and displays the resource state.
This program was built using online gdb. You can also run it under ubuntu with the instructions below. Follow the instructions and you will be good to go.
